# mtg-mechanics-parser

mtg-mechanics-parser is a rules-based parsing and scoring system for creature cards in *Magic: The Gathering*.

The project transforms raw card data from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) into structured gameplay features by parsing a card's Oracle text, identifying game mechanics, extracting quantitative features, and assigning a weighted power score.

Unlike traditional tabular datasets, *Magic* card text encodes structured game rules in natural-language form, including actions, triggered events, costs, restrictions, and continuous effects. As a result, evaluating card strength is a non-trivial task even for experienced *Magic: The Gathering* players, as it requires interpreting mechanics embedded in text rather than explicit structured fields.

Additionally, similar gameplay mechanics can be expressed through many distinct textual patterns. This makes rules-based parsing challenging, requiring a large set of pattern-matching rules and feature-specific extraction logic.

To address this challenge, this project implements a complete processing pipeline from scratch:

* Dataset cleaning and building
* Oracle text parsing
* Ability segmentation and classification
* Mechanic-specific feature extraction
* Feature vector generation
* Weighted card scoring

No external NLP or machine learning libraries are used for mechanic detection; all parsing, classification, and feature extraction logic is implemented using domain-specific systems designed for *Magic: The Gathering* card text.

The parser currently analyzes creature cards and detects a wide range of gameplay mechanics including removal, card advantage, token generation, mana production, reanimation, counters, triggered abilities, activated abilities, and global effects.

The resulting feature representations can be used for card evaluation, dataset analysis, machine learning experiments, and gameplay complexity research.

## Why This Project Exists

*Magic: The Gathering* contains tens of thousands of unique cards whose functionality is primarily expressed through natural-language Oracle text.

While datasets such as Scryfall provide extensive card metadata, many important gameplay characteristics are not available as structured features. For example, determining whether a card generates card advantage, creates tokens, removes opposing permanents, or reanimates creatures often requires interpreting the card's rules text.

By converting card text into structured mechanic-level features, those nuanced gameplay characteristics can be analyzed computationally.

The long-term goal is to provide a foundation for card evaluation, power-level estimation, and machine learning models operating on gameplay-relevant card characteristics.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/AgentSamSA/mtg-mechanics-parser.git
cd mtg-mechanics-parser
pip install -e .
```

To run this in a virtual python environment:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## System Pipeline

mtg-mechanics-parser processes *Magic: The Gathering* card data from Scryfall and converts a card's Oracle text into structured gameplay features that can be used to estimate card power.

The main challenge is that identical gameplay mechanics can appear in many syntactically different forms, requiring rules-based pattern matching rather than simple keyword detection.

### Stage 1: Data Preparation

Raw card data is downloaded from Scryfall and is filtered to include only creature cards. The dataset is then cleaned to remove unnecessary fields, invalid records, and filter down to only the columns we are interested in.

### Stage 2: Ability Parsing

Oracle text is segmented into individual ability blocks and converted into structured Ability objects. This separates activated abilities, triggered abilities, and static abilities for downstream processing.

### Stage 3: Card Context Construction

Relevant card information such as mana cost, power/toughness, keywords, and parsed abilities is assembled into a unified Card object that is passed through the extraction pipeline.

### Stage 4: Feature Extraction

Feature extractors analyze card text and identify gameplay mechanics such as:

* Card draw
* Token generation
* Mana production
* Removal effects
* Reanimation
* Damage effects
* Global effects
* Counter placement
* Activated abilities
* Triggered abilities

Each extractor produces structured feature values that quantify the complexity and gameplay impact of the card.

### Stage 5: Scoring

Extracted features are converted into weighted scores using predefined scoring rules. Individual component scores are combined into a final card power score.

The resulting score can be used for downstream analysis, comparison, and evaluation of creature card power level.

## Package Overview

### data/

Responsible for dataset acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing.

---

### parsing/

Responsible for converting Oracle text into structured ability representations.
- Ability types are identified via an `Ability` object which parses the ability from the Oracle text

---

### pipeline/

Coordinates end-to-end processing of individual cards.
- `build_context` identifies which lines of text are keyword abilities to avoid double scoring them. While Scryfall preprocesses keywords into a separate column, they retain the keywords inside Oracle text
- `card_ability_bundle` defines a CardAbilityBundle object which holds certain card-level metadata and a list of Ability objects for the parsed cards
- `extract_ability_blocks` builds out the list of ability blocks to be parsed downstream

---

### features/

Responsible for extracting gameplay-relevant mechanics from card text. Outputs structured feature vectors describing card functionality.
- Each extractor inside `features/extractors` is responsible for extracting their respective feature from the ability text. For instance, `destroy.py` is responsible for extracting any removal effects (destroy/exile)
- `AbilityFeature`, `CardFeature`, and `KeywordFeature` objects are defined in order to score the cards
- Regex strings were utilized in order to match ability text to features. These strings are stored under `constants/searches.py`

---

### scoring/

Converts extracted features into numeric power scores. Utilizes that card's Feature objects and weights to determine final score.

---

### constants/

Stores configuration values used throughout the project, including feature weights and feature extractor pipeline initialization.

---

### utils/

Shared utility functions used across multiple modules.

## Known Limitations
As *Magic* text is incredibly complex, there are certain cases that are currently not handled by our parser. Our goal is to eventually be able to handle each of these edge cases, but our current list includes:
- Transforming/double face cards
- Certain ability downsides
- Cases of nonscoring text, such as text that exists purely as part of card instantiation (e.g. "This creature enters with an oil counter on it."). See cards like [Evolved Spinoderm](https://scryfall.com/card/one/166/evolved-spinoderm)
- Many joke cards with mechanics not in the formally defined rules

In general, the parser tends to overscore cards relative to their actual power level, due to the current limitations on handling downsides and nonscoring text.  
This parser also currently only handles creature cards, as they are relatively simple to work with, and most importantly, include a quantifiable set of values (power/toughness) that allows us to establish a baseline.  

Other card types, such as instants and sorceries, can be incredibly complex and can include very unique text that is hard to score, such as is the case with cards like [Indomitable Creativity](https://scryfall.com/card/aer/85/indomitable-creativity).
